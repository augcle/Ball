Balls and Their Admirers

This is a small graphical simulation written in C using the raylib library.
It creates a window filled with colorful balls that each “follow” another ball, creating a dynamic, chain-like movement pattern.

Randomly generates 100 balls with:
- Random positions
- Random velocities
- Random sizes and colors
- Each ball is assigned another ball to follow.
- Positions and velocities update in real time.
- Uses modular arithmetic to wrap movement around window edges.
- Smooth animation using raylib’s drawing functions.
